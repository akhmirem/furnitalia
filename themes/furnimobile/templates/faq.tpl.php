<h4>Defective merchandise and shipping / freight damage:</h4>
<p>Damaged furniture is rare, but in case you get damaged furniture, you should make sure to take digital photos of the damages including the damaged packaging materials (if any) before the delivery person leaves. Call us immediately at <a href="tel:+19164840333">(916) 484-0333</a> and we shall guide you on how to resolve the matter at the earliest.<br/>
Purchaser shall inspect all packages before signing the delivery ticket. If Purchaser feels merchandise is defective upon receipt, he/she must contact Furnitalia within 24 hours of receipt thereof and provide digital photos and a description of the problem. Once Furnitalia has determined that the merchandise is defective, Furnitalia, at its discretion, may exchange or repair the merchandise.<br/>
In the event that damaged merchandise arrives at Purchaser's location, Purchaser shall take the following steps to insure that a freight claim can be filed:<br/><br/>
<span style="text-decoration:underline">Items Shipped Via Third Party:</span>
<ul>
	<li>Note on the freight company delivery receipt "Damaged" with a description of the piece.</li>
	<li>Notify the Furnitalia Shipping Department within 24 hours of receipt.</li>
	<li>Keep all packing material for inspection.</li>
	<li>Take digital photographs of the damaged item and packing material.</li>

	<li>For customers who follow these steps, Furnitalia will file a freight claim with the shipper and arrange for repair or send a replacement. Purchaser will bear sole responsibility for any damaged merchandise that arrives at Purchaser's location if any of the above steps are not taken. If the freight company damages goods on return shipment to Furnitalia, it is Purchaser's responsibility to make the freight claim.</li>
